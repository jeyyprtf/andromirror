   - Verify with `scrcpy --version`

3. **Device not detected**
   - Enable USB Debugging on your Android device
   - Check USB cable connection
   - Try different USB ports
   - Refresh device list

4. **Wireless connection fails**
   - Ensure device and computer are on the same network
   - Check if wireless ADB is enabled on the device
   - Try connecting via USB first, then switch to wireless

5. **Application won't start**
